# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this analysis was to visualize earthquake data on a leaflet map. While we had already mapped earthquakes of various magnitudes, this project expanded on that to include information on tectonic plates and "major earthquakes" with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater. I also added a dark map layer as a third option to select from.
